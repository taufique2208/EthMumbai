# **Digitest: Decentralizing Online Assessments**

## **Introduction**

Digitest is a revolutionary online assessment portal built with the goal of decentralization and enhanced data security. We leverage blockchain technology to create a secure and transparent platform for conducting assessments and storing student responses.

## **Core Features**

- **Decentralization:** By utilizing blockchain technology, Digitest empowers you to eliminate reliance on centralized servers, fostering increased security and tamper-proof data storage.
- **Enhanced Data Security:** Student responses are encrypted before storage, ensuring only authorized users – admins and students themselves – can access them. This safeguards data from unauthorized access or potential breaches.
- **Transparency:** With blockchain technology, the entire assessment process becomes more transparent. All participants (assessors, admins, students) have access to an immutable record of events, promoting trust and accountability.

## **Technology Stack**

- **Scaffold ETH 2:** Digitest's foundation is built upon Scaffold ETH 2, a robust framework for rapid and efficient Ethereum full-stack development. This framework streamlines the creation of web applications that interact with blockchain networks.
- **Next.js:** Next.js serves as the web application framework, offering server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) capabilities for optimal performance and user experience.
- **Hardhat:** We leverage Hardhat, a comprehensive Ethereum development environment, for smart contract compilation, deployment, and testing, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the contracts.

## **Scaffold ETH 2 Components**

Digitest effectively utilizes various essential components provided by Scaffold ETH 2:

- **Address Management:** Seamless integration with popular web3 wallets like MetaMask and WalletConnect for user authentication and transaction signing, simplifying the user experience.
- **Web3 Provider Setup:** Efficient establishment of communication between the Digitesr application and the Ethereum network, enabling interaction with smart contracts.
- **Customizable Components:** We have the flexibility to adapt and extend Scaffold ETH 2's components to meet the specific needs of Digitesr, ensuring a tailored and well-aligned solution.

**Web Hooks**

Scaffold ETH 2's web hooks provide a powerful mechanism for optimizing read and write operations within our application. This allows us to optimize data fetching and smart contract interactions, enhancing responsiveness and user experience.

## **Benefits of Scaffold ETH 2**

- **Reduced Development Time:** Scaffold ETH 2's pre-built components and streamlined development process significantly cut down development time, allowing us to focus on core functionalities and innovation.
- **Simplified Smart Contract Interaction:** The framework facilitates effortless interaction between the web application and smart contracts, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Improved Developer Experience:** Scaffold ETH 2 contributes to a more productive development experience by offering a user-friendly environment, modular components, and clear documentation.
